## Challenge

Once you complete the installation and have run the sample program you will be able to see the Flutter Demo app like this.

This is a really simple counter app. As soon as you push the button then the counter goes up and that's pretty much all it does.

But if you've gotten this far, then congratulations, you have completed all of the steps in the setup and you are now ready to start building Flutter apps.

What I want you to try out today is to remove the **debug banner** from the top right corner of the demo app.
